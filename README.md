**Description**

**Goal**

The goal of this project is, to how we can build a Reusable KYC credential System on ICP

**User Flow**

1. When a user comes to any DApp (Verifier App), to connect with it and use the DApps services user needs to do KYC. Here User gets redirected to the KYC provider via the `KYC-Widget`.

2. The `KYC-Widget` consists of a few verifications such as Face check(liveliness check), Passport Document Verification, etc.
 
3. At `KYC-Widget` Various Verifications get done and claims of those get sent to the Credential Issuer to issue credentials. The `KYC-widget` further calls the `Credential-issuer` once the KYC is completed at the KYC widget. The `Credential-issuer` gets the KYC credentials claims and issues various types of Credentials in the format of [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#ii-verifiable-credential-spec-mvp) spec. For example: Proof of Personhood, Proof of Age, Proof of Citizenship, etc.


5. These Credentials get stored in the Users `ID-Wallet` and their credential status gets anchored on the Verifiable Credential Status Registry (VDR). This VDR is a canister smart contract on the ICP blockchain.

The credential issuer has a unique `CanisterID` to update the credential status on the smart contract

7. Now once the user has various credentials in his `ID-Wallet`, the Verifier App can request credentials/proof. Whenever required, the user can mint NFT or custom tokens for generated ZK-proofs in his `ID-wallet`. For miniting NFT on ICP followed by [DIP-721](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721) standard, the Verifier App can request credentials from the user.

The ZK-Proofs in this, are generated by using [arkworks-rust](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) library. This library uses zkSnark programming for proofs generation in Rust.

9. This request is followed by [DIF-Presenation-request](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/) format. The verifier can request credentials from the user by mentioning `IssuerId` and `credentialSpec`.

6. Once the User gets the request from the Verifier, the user can generate zero-knowledge proof of the given `credentialSpec`. For ex: zero-knowledge-proof for membership or zk-proof of Age to mint NFT from NFT canister smart contract.

For Verifying Credential Status, the Verifier can query the Canister Smart contract (VDR) by passing `canisterId` and can check the status of Credentials.
